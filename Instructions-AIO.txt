Instructions for installing Contrail-Builder and All-In-One VM
The Contrail-Builder VM acts as a the installer as well as a proxy server for any
connectivity to/from the Contrail-AIO VM.

Prep
1.  Obtain a routable/networked IP address (RFC1918) that can connect to the Internet to
    download updates, packages and applications.  This IP is for the Contrail-Builder VM
    and gets assigned to eth0/vnic1.
    **Note eth1/vnic2 is statically assigned for the build and setup in the
    next step.
2.  Create a new port-group on the ESXi server.  This port-group should be a
    non-routed port-group that will only be used to connect the Builder and
    Contrail VMs to each other.



Install
1.  Import the Contrail-Builder ova file
2.  Power on the VM
3.  Log into the VM's console with 'root'
4.  Change the IP address of eth0 (obtained in Prep step 1) in the
    /etc/network/interfaces file and save:

    iface eth0 inet static
        address 10.180.21.79          <--CHANGE
        netmask 255.255.255.0         <--CHANGE
        network 10.180.21.0           <--CHANGE
        broadcast 10.180.21.255       <--CHANGE
        gateway 10.180.21.254         <--CHANGE
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers 10.180.21.21 10.180.21.22       <--CHANGE
        dns-search lab.lab
5.  Reboot the VM
6.  You can connect as root via ssh or the console into the Builder VM.
7.  Edit the following lines in the /Builder/Packer/Contrail-AIO.json file and
    save:
      a.  line 32: remote_host (ESXi server)
      b.  line 33: remote_datestore (on the ESXi server)
      c.  line 35: remote_username (ESXi user)
      d.  line 36: remote_password (ESXi password)
      e.  line 40: ethernet0.networkName (vSwitch name on ESXi)
8.  Start the build process by running:
      'packer build /Builder/Packer/Contrail-AIO.json'
9.  This should start and complete the Packer build process.  Depending on the resources
    of the ESXi server, it should take 25-30 minutes from start to finish.
    You will see the output from Packer to cli while the builder runs.
      a.  builder runs in packer to create the VM itself on the ESXi server
      b.  Downloads the Ubuntu server ISO and calls a preseed config file to
          build and configure the OS.
